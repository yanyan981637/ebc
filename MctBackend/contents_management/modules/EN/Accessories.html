Providing further levels of scalability and flexibility to TYAN&amp;#39;s growing line of system boards and barebones servers, the TARO SO-DIMM add-on cards deliver storage options for any level of system integration required. Using controllers from well-known manufacturers such as Adaptec&amp;reg;, the TARO line delivers configurations ranging from 2-port up to 8-port, and also includes built-in RAID support and optional boot-from-controller features, all for a completely cost-effective storage add-on solution. </body></html>
